Empowering Communities: The Strategic CSR Partnership Between Coforge & ASTHA
Our Shared Vision
Coforge Ltd. and ASTHA have entered into a development partnership with a clear mission: to ensure that the communities where social projects are implemented benefit substantially. Our goal is to create a positive impact that far outweighs the resources provided, ensuring these communities gain lasting value through a vision of long-term transformation.
The Partnership at a Glance
This collaboration is built on a foundation of transparency and strategic growth. Coforge has provided a grant of INR 15 lakhs to ASTHA to lead a comprehensive project focused on "Increasing Effectiveness of CSR projects". This initiative, spanning from January 2023 to December 2023, ensures that every social intervention is both impactful and compliant with national mandates.
Strategic Objectives & Impact
To achieve our vision, ASTHA provides Coforge with high-level strategic inputs and operational support, including:
• ESG Roadmap Development: Designing a three-to-five-year roadmap aligned with the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) framework to guide action plans and budgets.
• Operational Excellence: Drafting Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to streamline CSR activities across all corporate units, ensuring a uniform and professional approach.
• Capacity Building: Identifying and training implementation partners to ensure they meet the high expectations and standards of our programs.
• Monitoring & Impact Assessment: Establishing rigorous monitoring and evaluation systems and conducting third-party impact assessments to suggest necessary course corrections.
• Employee Engagement: Creating a dedicated platform to involve Coforge employees directly in CSR interventions, fostering a culture of giving back.
• Transparent Reporting: Compiling detailed impact data for annual reports, public disclosures, and various CSR award applications.
Commitment to Ethical Standards
Both Coforge and ASTHA operate under a strict code of ethics to ensure that our social work is as clean as it is impactful. This partnership strictly adheres to:
• Anti-Corruption Laws: Full compliance with national and international laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
• Fair Labour Practices: A zero-tolerance policy for any form of slave, forced, or child labour.
• Safe Workplaces: Maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment, where every individual is treated with dignity.
• Animal Welfare: Ensuring that no animals or birds are harmed or cruelly treated during the performance of any project.
Looking Ahead
Through this partnership, we are not just funding projects; we are building a sustainable infrastructure for social change. By combining Coforge’s resources with ASTHA’s expertise, we are ensuring that our corporate social responsibility is more than just a mandate—it is a measurable, transformative force for good.
