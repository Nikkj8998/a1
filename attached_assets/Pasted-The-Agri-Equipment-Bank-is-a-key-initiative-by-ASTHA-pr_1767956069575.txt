The Agri Equipment Bank is a key initiative by ASTHA, primarily implemented in the Pasali Valley (18 Gav Maval) region of Pune, designed to modernise traditional farming and reduce physical labour.
The following sections provide detailed information on its operations, inventory, and impact:
1. Core Objectives and Strategy
The primary goal of the bank is to reduce the "drudgery" (physical burden) associated with manual farming tasks. By providing access to modern machinery, the project encourages farmers to cultivate second and third crops (Rabbi), such as potatoes and wheat, which were previously avoided due to labour shortages and high costs.
2. Operational and Financial Model
The bank operates using a dual-delivery model:
• Shared Rental Service: Larger assets are retained by ASTHA and provided to the community at reasonable daily rental rates. As of recent reports, this model has collected ₹1.52 Lakh in user fees, which contributes to a Sustainability Fund for long-term maintenance.
• Subsidised Distribution: Smaller hand tools are sold directly to farmers. For example, 300 sickles were distributed at a 50% subsidised cost.
• Infrastructure: To ensure the longevity of the machinery, ASTHA plans to construct a semi-pakka tool shed for secure storage and maintenance.
3. Inventory and Technical Standards
The bank maintains a diverse range of equipment tailored for hilly terrain:
• Heavy Machinery: Mini-tractors (used for land preparation and dehusking), power weeders, and power reapers.
• Specialised Tools: Brush cutters and augers (used for digging plantation pits).
• Quality Control: Based on operational experience, the trust has shifted towards procuring branded Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) machines, as local alternatives frequently suffered from part breakages.
4. Quantifiable Impact and Efficiency
The introduction of the equipment bank has led to significant time and financial savings for the 104 participating families:
• Labour Savings: Using an auger for tree plantations saved approximately 300 person-days of manual labour.
• Cost Efficiency: Power weeders were used across 105 gunthas, saving farmers an estimated ₹25,200 in labour costs.
• Productivity: The availability of equipment has enabled the successful first-time cultivation of potatoes in the region.
5. Future Expansion
ASTHA intends to further expand the bank's capabilities by procuring tractor attachments (such as rotavators and trolleys), electric saws, and additional rice-sowing tools by March 2025. There is also a long-term plan to transition the management of these services to a Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO).
