The Association for Social Transformation and Human Advancement (ASTHA) promotes Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA) as a strategic shift to move farmers away from chemical dependency and toward more economically viable and ecologically sound practices.
The following details outline the organisation’s approach to organic practices:
1. Addressing the Chemical Crisis
• Soil and Health Restoration: The initiative is a direct response to the deterioration of soil nutrition caused by chemical fertilisers, which have also left residues affecting the health of the local population.
• Economic Viability: By reducing the need for expensive external chemical inputs, the project aims to make farming more profitable for small-scale landholders.
2. Provision of Organic Bio-Inputs
• Types of Inputs: ASTHA provides essential organic bio-inputs, including organic manures and specialised microbial solutions, to restore soil texture and nutrient levels.
• Direct Support: In the Pasali Valley project, 38 out of 80 farmers have already been supported with the spraying of bio-inputs on their crops.
• Vegetable Nurseries: The organisation also distributes saplings (such as tomato, chilli, and brinjal) to "Parasbag" (kitchen garden) farmers to encourage organic home cultivation.
3. Technical Training and Expert Guidance
• On-Field Mentorship: ASTHA employs agriculture graduates to provide direct technical guidance to farmers regarding organic inputs and optimal crop combinations.
• Behavioural Shift: A notable success of this training is that participating farmers now show a preference for waiting for organic treatment advice during fungal attacks rather than immediately reverting to chemical pesticides.
• Demonstration Plots: The project utilises "Farmers by Choice" (FbC)—innovative local farmers—who provide land for demonstration plots to showcase the effectiveness of organic methods to the wider community.
4. Impact on Crop Production
• Successful Trials: These organic practices have facilitated the successful first-time cultivation of potatoes in the region, alongside healthy yields of wheat and chickpeas (Harbara).
• Resilience: Despite minor fungal issues, crops grown under the LEISA framework have been reported as healthy and productive.
5. Future Integration
• Long-term Sustainability: ASTHA’s future roadmap includes a continued emphasis on organic farming techniques and the maintenance of biogas plants to provide a steady supply of natural fertilisers.

Analogy for Understanding: Think of LEISA as a "nutritional detox" for the land. Instead of giving the soil "energy drinks" (chemical fertilisers) that provide a quick boost but eventually ruin its health, ASTHA provides a natural, balanced diet (bio-inputs) and expert coaching (technical training). This allows the farm to build its own natural strength and remain productive for years without being "addicted" to expensive external chemicals.
