Swadhar

Based on the sources provided, the Swadhar Project is a collaborative initiative focused on rural development. Below is the detailed information regarding the project:
• Nature of Collaboration: It is a joint project between Jnana Prabodhini and Astha Trust.
• Location: The project is situated in the Velhe Block.
• Funding and Sponsorship: The project was sponsored by Coforge, with the budget managed through Jnana Prabodhini.
• Primary Focus Areas: The initiative targeted three main pillars:
    ◦ Livelihood.
    ◦ Environment.
    ◦ Gram Panchayat Governance.
• Project Timeline: The formal project period concluded in March 2024, but several core activities have been sustained beyond this date.
• Ongoing Activities (Post-March 2024): Even after the official conclusion, the Trust continues to facilitate three specific areas:
    ◦ Goat Rearing FPO (Farmer Producer Organisation): This is now part of the Pasli SHG cluster. While Jnana Prabodhini coordinates the financial and banking aspects, Astha handles animal health care, awareness, and goat housing.
    ◦ Improved Farming: Continued support for modernised agricultural techniques.
    ◦ Food Processing: Overseeing the operations of a dedicated food processing unit.
• Environmental Impact: As part of the environmental pillar, the project included well recharging; the Trust plans to monitor the long-term impact of these efforts through 2026.
To understand the Swadhar Project, think of it as a scaffolding for a new building. While the "scaffolding" (the formal project timeline and external funding) was removed in early 2024, the "building" itself (the FPOs, farming improvements, and food units) is now standing on its own, with the Trust providing the necessary maintenance to ensure it remains functional.


Key Points 


Drawing from the sources provided, here are the key points regarding the Swadhar Project:
• Partnership and Location: The project was a collaborative effort between Jnana Prabodhini and Astha Trust, specifically based in the Velhe Block.
• Sponsorship: It was sponsored by Coforge, with the project budget managed through Jnana Prabodhini.
• Focus Areas: The initiative was built upon three primary pillars: Livelihood, Environment, and Gram Panchayat Governance.
• Project Status: The formal project period concluded in March 2024.
• Continued Activities: Despite its official conclusion, the Trust has maintained three core activities:
    ◦ Goat Rearing FPO: Now integrated into the Pasli SHG cluster. While Jnana Prabodhini manages banking and finance, Astha is responsible for animal health care, awareness, and housing.
    ◦ Farming Enhancements: Ongoing support for improved farming techniques.
    ◦ Processing Unit: Continued oversight of the food processing unit.
• Long-term Monitoring: As part of the environmental focus, the Trust has committed to monitoring the impact of well recharging that was carried out during the project’s lifespan.
To better understand the project's transition, it functions like a graduating student. While the "schooling" (the formal project period and external sponsorship) has ended, the "graduate" (the FPOs and farming units) is now out in the world, with the Trust acting as a mentor to ensure they continue to succeed and grow on their own.

Solar Power

Based on the sources provided, the Astha Trust’s Solar Power initiatives are focused on improving rural infrastructure and lighting. Key information regarding these projects includes:
• Scope and Location: The Trust is providing solar-powered street and home lighting specifically for three villages located in the Velhe Block,.
• Sponsorship: This initiative is sponsored by Xorient (also referred to in the sources as Xoriant),,.
• Current Status: As of the September 2025 review, the project was noted as being under execution.
• Future Plans (2025–26): Moving into the next phase, the Trust has resolved to oversee the solar street lights introduced under this collaboration to ensure their continued maintenance and efficacy.
To understand the role of this project, you can think of it as planting "luminous trees" in the villages. Once these solar lights are fully "rooted" (installed), they require minimal external fuel but need regular "pruning" (oversight and maintenance) by the Trust to ensure they continue to provide safety and light to the community after the initial planting phase is over.


Key points

Based on the sources, the Astha Trust’s solar power initiative is a key part of its rural infrastructure development. The key points regarding this project are as follows:
• Primary Objective: The project focuses on providing both solar-powered street lighting and home lighting to improve safety and quality of life.
• Target Location: The initiative is specifically being implemented in three villages located within the Velhe Block.
• Sponsorship: The project is made possible through a collaboration with Xorient (also referred to as Xoriant in the sources), who serves as the primary sponsor.
• Current Status: As of the September 2025 meeting, the project was described as being under execution.
• Future Oversight: For the 2025–26 period, the Trust has committed to overseeing the solar street lights introduced through this collaboration to ensure they are properly maintained and functional for the community.
To understand the long-term goal of this project, you can think of it as planting "luminous trees" in the villages. Once these solar lights are fully "rooted" (installed), they require minimal external fuel, but the Trust acts as the gardener, providing the necessary oversight to ensure they continue to shine and provide safety to the residents after the initial setup is complete.
