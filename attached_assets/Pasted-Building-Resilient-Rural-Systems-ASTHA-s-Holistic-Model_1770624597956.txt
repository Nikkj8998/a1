Building Resilient Rural Systems: ASTHA’s Holistic Model
To enhance the rural ecosystem in the Velhe block, ASTHA implements an integrated strategy that transforms local resources into pathways for economic, social, and environmental resilience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Economic Empowerment: Livelihoods & Innovation
We revitalize the local economy by modernising traditional practices and building new skill sets:
• Sheti (Sustainable Agriculture): We shift focus to high-value rabi (second-season) crops like pulses and vegetables. Over 100 farmers receive training in organic practices, such as Jeevamrut and composting, to reduce costs and regenerate soil.
• Janavare (Livestock Development): Operating in 12 villages, we improve goat and poultry incomes through Osmanabadi genetic improvement, local feed production, and fair, weight-based market pricing.
• Udyogikta (Entrepreneurship): We conduct opportunity mapping in agro-tourism and food processing, providing seed capital and mentorship to help youth launch community-based ventures.
• Skill-Based Training: We deliver Entrepreneurship Development Training (EDT) and empower young women by training them as E-Rickshaw drivers and paravets ("Sheli Mitra").
• Equipment Bank: To reduce physical drudgery, we provide 300+ subsidized hand tools and a rental service for ASTHA-owned machinery, saving farmers hundreds of hours of manual labour.
2. Social & Political Strengthening: Building Community Power
We foster collective action and transparent governance to ensure long-term stability:
• Farmer Producing Organisations: We formed Goat Rearers’ SHGs and a shared Sustainability Fund where members contribute monthly, creating a revolving fund for collective purchases and maintenance.
• Organisation Buildup: Our model empowers women-led poultry farming and establishes local service networks run by trained youth to create a self-reliant village ecosystem.
• Political & Governance Impact: We build the capacity of local Panchayats for inclusive and decentralized planning. By using a matching grant model, we encourage community co-investment and ownership of civic projects.
3. Environmental Stewardship: Conservation & Climate Action
We protect the Western Ghats' biodiversity while empowering the community economically:
• Pani (Water Conservation): Addressing the block's water scarcity, we promote fodder cultivation on slopes and provide water turfs for livestock to manage resources efficiently in a high-rainfall yet water-stressed region.
• Increasing Biodiversity: We established a Native Tree Nursery with 5,000+ saplings of 28 tree species and planted over 1,000 native trees to restore local ecology.
• Environmental & Economic Empowerment: We utilize a solar-powered Rural Processing Centre to reduce carbon footprints and travel costs for farmers. Our annual Eco-Melas and biodiversity documentation (like the "Kolambichi Jaiv vividhata" book) revive traditional knowledge and create markets for local, climate-resilient foods.
